## Spray JSON Library

https://github.com/spray/spray-json
 
Most of type-class (de)serialization code is nothing but a polished copy of what Debasish Ghosh made available with his SJSON library.
These code parts therefore bear his copyright. Additionally the JSON AST model is heavily inspired by the one contributed
by Jorge Ortiz to Databinder-Dispatch.
